I am guided by a relentless curiosity.

Currently I am upskilling nearly every day with the goal of becoming a backend software engineer that designs, builds, and maintains serverside applications as well as cloud services. I began this pursuit in full in late 2022 when I decided to join the BloomTech Enterprise Backend Developer program to add some structure to the learning I was already doing on my own. I previously became fascinated by the vast capabilities of Amazon Web Services and started teaching myself as much as I could before ultimately deciding to join the program and enhance my learning capacity. 

With previous experience in object-oriented programming acquired during my time as a research assistant at the University of Texas Virtual Reality Lab and as a startup developer working on an educational app for the Vive and Oculus VR devices, I felt more than comfortable returning to the fray after a career hiatus during which I paid the bills as a professional poker player - an endeavor that required an incredible amount of discipline and ability, both teaching and sharpening a multitude of skills that transfer remarkably well to the professional world.
