<h2>🧙&nbsp;About Me&nbsp;🐺</h2>
I am guided by a relentless curiosity. <br><br>
I live in the Lone Star State with two dogs.<br><br>
I enjoy playing all kinds of card games. Magic is my favorite. I mostly play Esper colors - primary blue and secondary black/white. <br><br>
I also enjoy playing video games - grand strategy and 4X games like Total War, Stellaris, and Civ are my favorites, but I play games of all kinds. <br><br>

<h2>🏋&nbsp;Current Goals&nbsp;🌱</h2>
Currently I am upskilling nearly every day with the goal of becoming a backend software engineer that designs, builds, and maintains serverside applications as well as cloud services. I began this pursuit in full in late 2022 when I decided to join the BloomTech Enterprise Backend Developer program to add some structure to the learning I was already doing on my own. I previously became fascinated by the vast capabilities of Amazon Web Services and started teaching myself as much as I could before ultimately deciding to join the program and enhance my learning capacity. <br><br>
With previous experience in object-oriented programming acquired during my time as a research assistant at the University of Texas Virtual Reality Lab and as a startup developer working on an educational app for the Vive and Oculus VR devices, I felt more than comfortable returning to the fray after a career hiatus during which I paid the bills as a professional poker player - an endeavor that required an incredible amount of discipline and ability, both teaching and sharpening a multitude of skills that transfer remarkably well to the professional world.
